# staffing-request
Staffing request system which provides a list of potential candidates based on experience, education, salary, and location.  A client will be able to select up to three potential staff members along with the location of work, type of work, and salary and submit the request to the contract manager. Once a client issues a staffing request, the system shall provide an automated response stating that the contract manager will validate their request within 24 hours of receipt. Additionally, clients will be able to log into the site and search for a staff request by number to ensure the staff request is valid, invalid, unable to fill, or filled. TPS staff members can update their resumes and picture through the web site. Managers can retrieve a staffing request from the database, retrieve contract information, validate the staffing request, and close out the staffing requests.
